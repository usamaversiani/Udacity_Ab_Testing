# ðŸ§ª A/B Testing Analysis: Does a New Website Design Convert Better?

Redesigning a website isnâ€™t just about making it look better â€” itâ€™s about improving **user engagement and conversion**. But how do we know if a new design actually performs better?

Thatâ€™s where **A/B testing** comes in.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Objective

The goal of this project is simple:

> **Determine if a new website design leads to a higher conversion rate compared to the old design.**

Using real user data, we conducted a full A/B test analysis, from data cleaning to statistical hypothesis testing, to find out whether the redesign had a statistically significant impact.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Overview

The dataset used in this project comes from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), originally designed for the **Udacity A/B Testing course**. It mimics real-world web traffic data where:

- Users were randomly assigned to either a **control group** (old webpage) or a **treatment group** (new webpage).
- Each row includes:
  - `user_id`
  - `timestamp`
  - `group`
  - `landing_page`
  - `converted` (binary indicator of conversion)
